For my asset packs I sell them under the pro license that is outlined on GameDevFort.

If you bought these via itch or something else then it would be pretty much the same rules as outlined there.

Here's the simple summary:
Yes you can sell games made with these. You can make games using any engine or for any system.
You are free to edit these. You can't re-sell the graphics themselves. You can use them in any way and then sell anything that you use them in.
Non-exclusive. Other people have bought this pack too.

Enjoy, have fun. :D
